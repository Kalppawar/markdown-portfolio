 
_since I have started learning **C-language** my **logical** thinking has improved a lot. Making a computer do things as we wanted is fun._
I have learned a lot about working of computers on _binary languages_ and importance of a *programing language* to eastablish a connection between humans and machines.

I could solve some small _real world problems_ using c.

My **typing** speed has also improved.And
now I am learning **HTML** for website designing.
